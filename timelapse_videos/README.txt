You'll find timelapse videos generated from the PFC-EDU bots that were used in the 20 unit evaporation test done from Jan through Feb.

full_grid.mp4 provides a full grid of the 20 bots during the month long run.
Images from 3 bots are missing, and one is very much out of focus.

In the grid, the first column are bots running without an airstone and with normal fan speed.
The second column are bots runnig with an airstone, but with no fan.
The third column are the bots that were running without an airstone, and without a fan.
The fourth column are bots that had soil (rather than hydroponics), with no air fan.
The fifth column is the 'control' running with an airstone, and with the normal air fan.

You'll find the individual videos for each bot in the corresponding compressed subdirectory.
